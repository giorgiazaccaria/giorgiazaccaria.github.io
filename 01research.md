My work is mainly focused on latent variables models and mixture models with applications in different fields as psychometrics, socio-economics and environmental sciences. \
Specifically, my research interests are:
- dimensionality reduction;
- model-based clustering;
- ultrametric models;
- robust statistics;
- mixed-type data;
- model-based composite indicators.

### Ongoing projects
- **A model-based ultrametric composite indicator for studying waste management in Italian municipalities** \
with Carlo Cavicchia, Pasquale Sarnacchiaro and Maurizio Vichi \
_Under second review_

- **Parsimonious Gaussian mixture models with extended ultrametric covariance structures** \
with Carlo Cavicchia and Maurizio Vichi \
_Manuscript in preparation_

- **Ultrametric Gaussian Mixture Model with missing data and constraints** \
with Francesca Greselin \
_Manuscript in preparation_

- **Ultrametric Factor Analysis** \
with Carlo Cavicchia and Maurizio Vichi 

- **An ultrametric model for building a composite indicator system to study climate change in European countries** \
