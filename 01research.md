My work is mainly focused on latent variables models and mixture models with applications in different fields as psychometrics, socio-economics and environmental sciences. \
Specifically, my research interests are:
- dimensionality reduction;
- model-based clustering;
- ultrametric models;
- robust statistics;
- mixed-type data;
- model-based composite indicators.
