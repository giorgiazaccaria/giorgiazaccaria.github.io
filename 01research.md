My work is mainly focused on latent variables models and mixture models with applications in different fields as psychometrics, socio-economics and environmental sciences. \
Specifically, my research interests are:
- dimensionality reduction;
- model-based clustering;
- ultrametric models;
- hierarchical models;
- mixed-type data;
- model-based composite indicators.

### Ongoing projects
- **A model-based ultrametric composite indicator for studying waste management in Italian municipalities** \
with Carlo Cavicchia, Pasquale Sarnacchiaro and Maurizio Vichi \
_Revision required_

- **Ultrametric Factor Analysis** \
with Carlo Cavicchia and Maurizio Vichi 

- **Parsimonious Gaussian mixture models with extended ultrametric covariance structures** \
with Carlo Cavicchia and Maurizio Vichi \
_In preparation_

- **An ultrametric model for building a composite indicator system to study climate change in European countries** \
with Pasquale Sarnacchiaro

- **Stepwise Approach for Evaluating Covariate Effects on Mixture Multigroup Factor Analysis** \
with Jeroen Vermunt and Kim De Roover

- **Complex Dimensionality Reduction for Mixed-Type Data** \
with Marco Mingione and Maurizio Vichi
